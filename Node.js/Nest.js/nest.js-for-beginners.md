# What is Nest.js?

Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It is built on top of Express (by default) and uses TypeScript. Nest.js provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks but also exposes their APIs to the developer. This allows for easy use of the myriad third-party modules available for each platform.

# Why Use Nest.js?

Nest.js offers several advantages making it a compelling choice for server-side development:

## Structure
Nest.js provides a clear and well-defined structure right from the start. This structure helps in organizing the application and makes it more maintainable in the long run.

## Modularity
The framework emphasizes modularity, allowing developers to break down their application into different modules. This makes the codebase more manageable and scalable.

## TypeScript
Nest.js is built with TypeScript support and encourages its use, although it still enables developers to write in pure JavaScript. TypeScript provides strong typing and object-oriented programming features, leading to more robust and error-free code.

## GraphQL Integration
Nest.js has excellent support for GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs, and provides a straightforward way of building efficient and scalable APIs.

## Microservices
It is well-suited for building microservice architectures, offering various tools and features to handle inter-service communication effectively.

## RESTful API Development
Nest.js is a great choice for building RESTful APIs with its rich set of decorators and modules, simplifying the handling of HTTP requests and responses.

## Easy Documentation
With tools like Swagger, Nest.js makes it easy to document your APIs, which is essential for large-scale applications and teams.

## Popularity
Nest.js has been gaining popularity rapidly in the Node.js community due to its robust architecture and the convenience it offers. This popularity has led to a growing community and ecosystem, providing support and resources for developers.
